# Widgie
Widgie helps users manage their schoolwork and classes with multiple organizational tools. Users can easily access course information, store notes, add tasks to a to-do list, and more. The Widgie application houses all widgets on one main screen, including the to-do list, notepad, and calculator. When the application is opened, users can access and use any widgets they need. Widgie is designed to enhance student productivity; all widgets are on a single screen, eliminating the need to exit the application to access anything. This reduces the chance of distractions.
